Abstract: Initially, I started coding a really pretty Read-Me based on "The Neverending Story". The opening scene resonates with me, and something Jerome said last week about having a quiet place to work resonated as well. 
That being said, I started coding pink glittery words on a white background, like the viewer could be chilling with Falcor in the clouds. However, that was not the assignment.
Therefore, I scrapped what I had, and did all the reading on the Node.js, JSon packages, npm, etc.
Installation: I installed pug, and I found a raw list variable template which heavily mirrored exercises from the previous week. I generated a READ-ME generator prototype which asked
clients such questions as "would you rather have a glittery button, or a boring button"? Said questions were admittedly loaded, and the answers focused to me. I also installed JSON and then uninstalled JSON
when I didn't have permission to use it per Apple. I coded node.js and my little heart out on the command line.
Contributors: There are a litany of geniuses on the Github who evidently have made READ-ME Generators in an hour, done backflips, and then solved the world's problems. I was able to find three different question templates to generate rawlists. I created a prototype questionnaire of what a client might want.
Reflection: I climbed out of my pink glittery box and coded hard. I worked with the command line more this weekend then quite possibly the entire Bootcamp. The command line and I are BFF's now. 
My generator does not respond to index node.js. I am frustrataed by this. However, I coded the entire weekend. I did basic algebra. I used variables. I am ending here, as 
my idea of short is someone else's verbose. 
Acknowledgments: Thank you all for giving me this fantastic metaphorical video game which never ends. There will never be a last level to this. I am grateful for that. Good night.
